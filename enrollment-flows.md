# Best Practice: Enrollment Flow in COmanage

## 1  INTRODUCTION

This guide describes the process of starting and supervising an invitation-based enrollment flow in COmanage registry when adding participants to a COU.

## 2  SCOPE

Intended for collaboration administrators using COmanage registry.

## 3 ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS

*  CO: Collaboration Organization - A collection of people collaborating with a common workflow for adding additional collaborators and with common policies for vetting the identities of collaborators.

*  COU: Collaborative Organization Unit - The COU is an optional construct which allows to define an organizational structure within a CO. The workflow for enrolling people may have details specific to a COU.

## 4  PROCEDURE

### a. Inviting participants

*	Log in to COmanage registry and chose your CO
*	Go to the menu « People » and click « Enroll »
*	You will land on various options, select action « Begin » for Invitation  
*	You will land on the invitation form
*	Select the relevant COU and fill in the required information
*	Click submit 

You will see a page of recapitulatory information with a green box confirming that the invitation, also known as a « petition », has been created. The participant will receive an email with the link to enroll.  

### b. Checking petition’s status
Once you have invited the participants, you will have the possibility to check on their status and see whether their enrollment has been successful or completed.

To do so, click on the menu « People » and select « CO petitions ».

You will find a list of the petitions issued including the name of the participant, the type of their enrollment flow, the time at which the petition was created and modified.

You will also find under action, the button « Resend Invite » in case the petition expires before the participant completes enrollment.

Until the participant accepts and completes their enrollment, their status will show « pending confirmation ».  

Once the invitation is accepted by the participant and as they successfully complete their enrollment, you will no longer see their name in « CO petitions ». You will be able to find them in « My CO ‘Name of Your COU’ population ».
